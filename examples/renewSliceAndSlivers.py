# Renew your slice and slivers for 2 months
# To be run from a cron job that runs at least every 2 months, and better every 7 days or more
# to handle aggregates that limit slivers to 14 day duration.

# Then call this script as "renewSliceAndSlivers.py <slicename>"
# or
# "renewSliceAndSlivers.py <slicename> -r <projectname>"

# Assumes that the GENI Clearinghouse correctly knows all slivers in your slice.
# To ensure this, use Omni 2.7+ to do 'sliverstatus' at all aggregates with resources in your slice.

# Return code will be non-0 if there were errors.

# Sample crontab entry renewing slice mySliceName at 01:05 on the 1st, 8th, 15th and 22nd of every month:
# 5 1 1,8,15,22   *    * (export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/gcf/src; /usr/local/gcf/examples/renewSliceAndSlivers.py mySliceName > /dev/null 2>&1)

# Note however that the above crontab entry would hide any errors in renewal; a true
# production service should be watching errors in the logs and notifying
# appropriate parties.

# Note that this script uses a standard omni_config file and all the standard omni commandline options.

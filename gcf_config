# This is an INI style configuration file for the GENI Control Framework
# clearinghouse and aggregate manager

# This config is used by gen-certs, gcf-am.py, gcf-ch.py, and gcf-test.py

[global]
# GENI uses URNs to identify experimenters and resources
# The URN format is specified in the GENI AM document available at: http://www.geni.net/
# A URN is of form: urn:publicid:IDN+<domain>+<type>+<name>
# The base_name variable is where you specify the domain of your CH/AM/Users.
# EG User URNs issued by your CH will be:
# urn:publicid:IDN+<base_name>+user+<user name>
# Similarly for slice
# See below for the aggregate_manager suffix
# Examples include plc//princeton, geni//gpo//gcf, and emulab.net
# base_name is in publicid format. Seee XML1.0 spec.
# Do not use more than one whitespace in a row.
# Avoid:  <>"{}|\^`

base_name=geni//gpo//gcf



# The directory that stores the trusted roots of your CH/AM 
# and those you have federated with
# This can be a relative or absolute path.
rootcadir=~/.gcf-servers/trusted_roots



[clearinghouse]
# Address at which the Clearinghouse should listen. 0.0.0.0 means all interfaces. 
host=127.0.0.1
port=8000
# Path to the key/cert for the clearinghouse as generated by gen-certs
keyfile=~/.gcf-servers/ch-key.pem
certfile=~/.gcf-servers/ch-cert.pem
# Path to the file listing aggregates (URN, URL) that are affiliated with this clearinghouse
aggfile=~/.gcf-servers/geni_aggregates
# Duration of User credentials in seconds
user_cred_duration=86400
# Duration of Slice credentials in seconds
slice_duration=7200


[aggregate_manager]
# name is the name of your aggregate manager.  It gets appended to base_name
# when creating a URN for your aggregate manager
# EG: urn:publicid:IDN+<base_name from above>.am1+authority+am
# Resources managed by this AM be named relative to this, eg:
# urn:publicid:IDN+<base_name>.am1+node+myLinuxGCFBox
name=am1
# Address that the AM listens on
host=127.0.0.1
port=8001
# Cert/key locations
keyfile=~/.gcf-servers/am-key.pem
certfile=~/.gcf-servers/am-cert.pem


[client]
# Used for testing that the CH and AM are properly running
# This is the user key and cert.
keyfile=~/.gcf-servers/alice-key.pem
certfile=~/.gcf-servers/alice-cert.pem

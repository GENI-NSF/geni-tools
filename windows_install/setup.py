# Notes 6/2014
# Non python files are not added to library.zip
# Logging config not found in zip files
# data_files are not included in the archive, but are parallel to the archive
# Later ideally we'd get the .conf file into library.zip
# Or perhaps add in 'options' inside 'py2exe': 
# 'skip_archive': True
# That creates a lot more files that Inno Setup has to tar up (and more files that will 
# be in the final directory)

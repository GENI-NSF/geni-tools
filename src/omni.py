""" The OMNI client
    This client is a GENI API client that is capable of connecting
    to multiple slice authorities (clearinghouses) for slice creation and deletion.
    See README-omni.txt

    Be sure to create an omni config file (typically ~/.gcf/omni_config)
    and supply valid paths to your per control framework user certs and keys.
    See gcf/omni_config.sample for an example, and src/omni-configure.py
    for a script to configure omni for you.

    Typical usage:
    omni.py sfa listresources
    
    The currently supported control frameworks (clearinghouse implementations)
    are SFA (i.e. PlanetLab), PG and GCF.

    Extending Omni to support additional frameworks with their own
    clearinghouse APIs requires adding a new Framework extension class.

    Return Values and Arguments of various omni commands:
      Aggregate functions:
       Most aggregate functions return 2 items: A string describing the result, and an object for tool use.
       In AM APIV3+ functions, that object is a dictionary by aggregate URL containing the full AM API v3+ return struct
       (code, value, output).
       [string dictionary] = omni.py getversion # dict is keyed by AM url
       [string dictionary] = omni.py listresources # dict is keyed by AM url,urn
       [string dictionary] = omni.py listresources SLICENAME # AM API V1&2 only; dict is keyed by AM url,urn
       [string dictionary] = omni.py describe SLICENAME # AM API V3+ only
       [string rspec] = omni.py createsliver SLICENAME RSPEC_FILENAME # AM API V1&2 only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py allocate SLICENAME RSPEC_FILENAME # AM API V3+ only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py provision SLICENAME # AM API V3+ only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py performoperationalaction SLICENAME ACTION # AM API V3+ only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py poa SLICENAME ACTION # AM API V3+ only; alias for performoperationalaction
       [string dictionary] = omni .py sliverstatus SLICENAME # AM API V1&2 only
       [string dictionary] = omni .py status SLICENAME # AM API V3+ only
       [string (successList of AM URLs, failList)] = omni.py renewsliver SLICENAME # AM API V1&2 only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py renew SLICENAME # AM API V3+ only
       [string (successList of AM URLs, failList)] = omni.py deletesliver SLICENAME # AM API V1&2 only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py delete SLICENAME # AM API V3+ only
       In AM API v1&2:
       [string (successList, failList)] = omni.py shutdown SLICENAME
       In AM API v3:
       [string dictionary] = omni.py shutdown SLICENAME
       [string dictionary] = omni.py update SLICENAME RSPEC_FILENAME # AM API V3+ only
       [string dictionary] = omni.py cancel SLICENAME # AM API V3+ only

       Non-AM API functions exported by aggregates, supported by Omni:
       From ProtoGENI/InstaGENI:
       [string dictionary] = omni.py createimage SLICENAME IMAGENAME [false] -u <SLIVER URN>
       [string dictionary] = omni.py snapshotimage SLICENAME IMAGENAME [false] -u <SLIVER URN> ; alias for createimage
       [string dictionary] = omni.py deleteimage IMAGEURN [CREATORURN]
       [string dictionary] = omni.py listimages [CREATORURN]


      Clearinghouse functions:
       [string dictionary] = omni.py get_ch_version # dict of CH specific version information
       [string dictionary urn->url] = omni.py listaggregates
       On success: [string sliceurnstring] = omni.py createslice SLICENAME
       On fail: [string None] = omni.py createslice SLICENAME
       [stringCred stringCred] = omni.py getslicecred SLICENAME
       On success: [string dateTimeRenewedTo] = omni.py renewslice SLICENAME
       On fail: [string None] = omni.py renewslice SLICENAME
       [string Boolean] = omni.py deleteslice SLICENAME
       [string listOfSliceURNs] = omni.py listslices USER
       [string listOfSliceURNs] = omni.py listmyslices USER
       [string listOfSSHPublicKeys] = omni.py listmykeys
       [string listOfSSHPublicKeys] = omni.py listkeys USER
       [string stringCred] = omni.py getusercred
       [string string] = omni.py print_slice_expiration SLICENAME
       [string dictionary AM URN->dict by sliver URN of silver info] = omni.py listslivers SLICENAME
       [string listOfMemberDictionaries (KEYS, URN, EMAIL, ROLE)] = omni.py listslicemembers SLICENAME
       [string Boolean] = omni.py addslicemember SLICENAME USER [ROLE]
       [string Boolean] = omni.py removeslicemember SLICENAME USER

      Other functions:
       [string dictionary] = omni.py nicknames # List aggregate and rspec nicknames    
       [string dictionary] = omni.py print_sliver_expirations SLICENAME

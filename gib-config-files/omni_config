# This is a sample Omni config file
# It tells Omni how to talk to various Clearinghouses.
# And by extension, which Experimenter credentials to use.

# Omni looks for this file in 4 locations, using the first found
# 1) The location given by the -c command line arg - as a full path
# 2) The -c command line arg as a file relative to ~/.gcf
# 3) omni_config in the current directory
# 4) ~/.gcf/omni_config

# Any given instance of omni makes calls to a framework 
# (e.g., SFA, ProtoGENI, etc..) to create slices, get slice
# credentials, and to find a list of authorized aggregates.
# This file specifies the control frameworks that you are
# a member of and the users that you want to be able to login
# to your allocated resources (e.g., virtual machines)


[omni]
# The default control framework for omni to use.
# Override on the commandline with -f argument.
# This should be the name of a section that you define below
# Note you could have multiple instances of the same type
# configured, EG for different MyPLC instances.
# default_cf = my_gcf
default_cf = gib_ch

# The slice_users argument in "CreateSliver".  It uploads
# names and public ssh keys to allocated resources for login.
# Details on users should be defined in sections below
users = Alice


# Omni will by default contact every Aggregate Manager listed
# by your control framework's registry/clearinghouse.  If you would
# like to provide a specific list of aggregates to contact, do so 
# here in a comma delimited list of of urls.
# e.g., a PL in Princeton AM, a PG in Utah AM, a test GCF AM, and 
#  an OpenFlow/Expedient AM in the GPO lab would be: 
# aggregates = http://www.planet-lab.org:12347/, \
#  https://www.emulab.net/protogeni/xmlrpc/am, \
#  http://myplc2.gpolab.bbn.com:8001/, \
#  https://masada.gpolab.bbn.com:443/openflow/gapi/


# You can also tell Omni a single aggregate URL to contact, with the -a
# argument. In addition, rather than remembering the URL, you can define a
# nickname for the aggregate here. This is completely optional.

#------AM nicknames
# Format :
# Nickname=URN, URL
# URN is optional

This file documents how to install and run the gcf package, including
the Omni command-line tool.

See README.txt for details on the usage of the gcf package, and
README-omni.txt for details on Omni.

Omni users should follow these install instructions to ensure software dependencies are met.
Omni users using Mac OS X or Windows might consider the pre-built binaries available
from https://github.com/GENI-NSF/geni-tools/wiki.

== 1. Create the gcf directory ==

      * If you have downloaded the software from the git repository, you can skip this step.
      {{{
      tar xvfz gcf-2.10.tar.gz
      }}}
      * Move the gcf directory to the directory where you want to permanently keep gcf. This might be your home directory. [[BR]]If you have `sudo` privileges in your host, you might want to consider moving the gcf package under `/usr/local/bin/` for a cleaner setup. 
      {{{
      [sudo] mv gcf-2.10 <install-dir>
      }}}
      * Create a symbolic link  called `gcf` to your installation directory. This will make the process of upgrading omni easier.
         - If this is your first time installing gcf, do:
      {{{
      cd <install-dir>
      rm gcf; ln -s gcf-2.10 gcf
      }}}
         - If you are upgrading your gcf, do:
      {{{
      cd <install-dir>
      ln -s gcf-2.10 gcf
      }}}
==  2. Add GCF to your path == 

In order to be able to run omni.py, gcf-am.py and any of the scripts
(e.g. readyToLogin.py) you will need to modify the `PATH` and the
`PYTHONPATH` environment variables. 

Also it is useful to add aliases to the commonly used commands so that you 
don't have to specify the `.py` in your commands; e.g. you can
configure omni by just running `omni-configure` instead of
`omni-configure.py`

It is recommended that you make these modifications in a configuration file so that they are set every
time you login to your host.  The name of the configuration file is
dependent on the shell you are running. 

In order to figure out which shell you are using run:
{{{
 ps -p $$
}}}

If you are using a bash shell, copy and paste these lines to the end
of your `.bashrc` file. This file is located in your home
directory. If the file does not exist, you can create it. 
If you are using a different shell, then modify these lines appropriately and add
them to the configuration file of your shell. Make sure to replace
`<PATH-TO-GCF-DIR>` with the actual path to your gcf directory. For
example if you have installed gcf under `/usr/local/bin/` then
`<PATH-TO-GCF-DIR>` is `/usr/local/bin/gcf`.

{{{
# set PATH so it includes geni software if it exists
if [ -d "<PATH-TO-GCF-DIR>/src" ] ; then
    PATH="<PATH-TO-GCF-DIR>/src:<PATH-TO-GCF-DIR>/examples:$PATH"
    export PYTHONPATH="<PATH-TO-GCF-DIR>/src:$PYTHONPATH" 
fi

alias omni='omni.py'
alias omni-configure='omni-configure.py'
alias readyToLogin='readyToLogin.py'
alias clear-passphrases='clear-passphrases.py'
alias stitcher='stitcher.py'
alias remote-execute='remote-execute.py'
alias addMemberToSliceAndSlivers='addMemberToSliceAndSlivers.py'
}}}

For the changes to take effect in your current terminal run:
{{{
   source <configuration_file>
}}}

== 3. Install software dependencies ==
The GCF package is intended to be run on a recent Unix
distribution. Python 2.6 or better is required. This software is not
Python 3 compatible. This software requires a number of readily
available software packages. Most modern Linux distributions should
have these packages available via their native package management
suite (eg. yum or apt). 

Read the appropriate INSTALL.* file for installing dependencies for your
specific platform (e.g. read the INSTALL.ubuntu for instructions about
installing dependencies on an Ubuntu host). 

If there are no instructions for you OS, look at the software dependencies at
this file and install them manually. 
 Email [mailto:gcf-developers@googlegroups.com] for help.
 NOTE: '''Windows users''', you might want to consider using Cygwin.

If you want to take a look at the detailed list of software dependencies look 
in this file, in section "Software Dependencies".

== 4. Configure and test the installation ==
      * Look at README-omni.txt for configuring Omni. 
      * Look at README-gcf.txt for configuring GCF.


= Upgrade =
In order to upgrade gcf, simply follow  [#a1.Createthegcfdirectory the instructions about creating a gcf directory].

'''NOTE''': If you have any configuration files (e.g. `omni_config` or
`gcf_config`) under the directory of your previous gcf installation,
make sure you move them under the new directory so that you still have
easy access to them.

== Software Dependencies ==

GCF depends on the following packages:

=== Python M2Crypto ===

The M2Crypto package provides utilities for handling X.509
certificates and SSL connections. M2Crypto is required by the
certificate class in sfa/trust. M2Crypto should be readily available
on most Linux distributions.

More information is available at: http://chandlerproject.org/bin/view/Projects/MeTooCrypto

=== Python dateutil ===

The dateutil package provides date parsing routines to Python. It
should be readily available on most Linux distributions.

More information is available at: http://labix.org/python-dateutil

=== Python OpenSSL ===

The OpenSSL package provides a python API to the OpenSSL
package. There is an implicit dependency on OpenSSL, but that
should be handled by the Linux package manager (yum, apt, etc.)

More information is available at: https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl

=== xmlsec1 ===

The XML Security Library provides implementations of XML Digital
Signatures (RFC 3275) and W3C XML Encryption. The program xmlsec1
from this package is used to sign credentials.

On rpm systems the required packages are:
 * xmlsec1
 * xmlsec1-openssl-devel

On debian systems the packages are 
 * libxmlsec1
 * xmlsec1
 * libxmlsec1-openssl
 * libxmlsec1-dev

INSTALLING OMNI TOOLS
---------------------
1. Drag the omniTools-2.10 icon to the Applications icon.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Run the script /Applications/omniTools-2.10/addAliases.command.  This script will add aliases for the various
   Omni Tools in your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile.  (The script looks for these 
   files in this order).

To test the installation:
1. Open a new terminal window.
2. In this terminal window, run the command:
       omni --version
   If omni prints out its version number, you are all set!


UNINSTALLING OMNI TOOLS
-----------------------
1. Drag the old version of omniTools folder from your Applications folder to Trash.
2. Optional: Delete the aliases created during the install.  These aliases are added to your 
   ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile.  Look for the comment:
   "# Aliases for commands in the GENI omniTools package"
